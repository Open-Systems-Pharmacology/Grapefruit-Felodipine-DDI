# Grapefruit-Felodipine-DDI
PBPK modeling of published grapefruit-felodipine DDI studies.

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of the CYP3A4 inactivator grapefruit (represented by its furanocoumarin ingredients bergamottin and 6,7-dihydroxybergamottin). The models of the furanocoumarin ingredients were developed using published plasma concentration measurements of the ingredients after grapefruit consumption and published concentration measurements of the ingredients in the fruit to determine dosing of the ingredients. The models were coupled to a PBPK model of felodipine to predict published clinical DDI studies. Hereby, the CYP3A4 inactivation was parametrized based on published _in vitro_ studies. The file "Grapefruit-Felodipine-DDI" contains simulations of the published clinical DDI studies, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation and extensive documentation, please refer to [[1]](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.2968).
